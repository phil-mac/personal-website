    <h1>About</h1>
    <div id="about">
      <div id="aboutText">
        <p>Hello. My name is Phil MacEachron. I moved around when growing up, living on the east and west coasts of the
          US, as well as in New Delhi, India. I studied physics in college and worked in the aerospace industry for few
          years where I developed low-gravity fluid devices. 
        </p>
          <p>I love building things that help people, learning, helping
          others learn, and spending time in nature. Currently Iâ€™m exploring the potential of spatial computing to
          improve physics education.</p>

    <h4>Physics Playground</h4>
    <div class="project">
      <p>This is a work-in-progress. I'm building it off the framework of CurieVR, but instead of only having pre-made
        simulations like CurieVR, it provides the tools for users to make their own educational physics simulations
        and lessons, and share them with others. It is multi-user and cross-platform, working on mobile and PC 6DoF VR
        systems, as well as in a desktop version in web browsers using WebGL.</p>

    <h4>CurieVR</h4>
    <div class="project">
      <p>CurieVR is a multi-user virtual physics classroom, for use in online education. It is available on Steam for PC
        VR in a closed beta. If you'd like a key, please email: phil at curievr.com. It contains interactive simulations
        to visualize and experiment with physics concepts, as well as learning tools such as a networked blackboard,
        slide deck, calculator, stopwatch, and tape measure.</p>

      <p>Users can share their own slides in the app via an embedded chromium browser. The app communicates with a
        simple Flask server written in Python and hosted on Google App Engine. The server accesses the Google Slides API
        to query data from the slide deck in order to create buttons that can be clicked in the app to jump to different
        slides and read widgets on the current slide to pose questions or load a simulation.</p>
